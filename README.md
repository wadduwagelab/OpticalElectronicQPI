This repository contains the code for the paper "Towards Ultrafast Quantitative Phase Imaging via Differentiable Microscopy".

1. Please download the HeLa cell dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18W_eL72HqVlmRqIt1COMaf2FVOE8PFav)
2. Notebook "HelaCells_dataPreprocessing.ipynb" contains preprocessing scripts for the dataset
3. Notebook "LFF_Dataset(HeLa)_x64Comp.ipynb" contains the script for end-to-end training, with Learnable Fourier Filter optical model, Hela cells dataset, and x64 compression. "input_img_size= 16" allows to conduct x256 compression experiments.
